Medicine Product.
Should be able

medicine product MVP:

* Fields:
    - name
    - product_url
    - price

## Design

for now it will just be a simple list of products, with the url
should be able to add one from the medicine detail, creating, editing and deleting can be done via a modal
could show the number of medicine products a medicine has in the medicine list

## Features

* should get the current price and save it into a database or could use an external service for that
* be able to add medicines to watch and get emails when price drops or other promos
* calculate how good is the price relative to other medicines products based on the price per presenting form(low
priority)
* could have a price history graph (very low priority)


## Questions
can I use an external service to track all of this or do I have to build it all on my own
# AI Chatbot

Natural language chatbot for asking the right medicine for a symptom or disease, should be able to search in the
existing database, and retrieve the product with the best price per presenting form and such
