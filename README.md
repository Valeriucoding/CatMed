## About

> This project is all about organizing information related to medicines, diseases, and the body parts they affect. You
> can create medicines in the system and link them to different organs or categorize them by the types of conditions
> they
> treat.

> The idea behind this project is to make it easier to keep track of medicines and how they’re connected to different
> diseases and body parts. It was created with the intention of helping doctors to quickly find the right medicine for a
> specific condition.
